##### I recently finished a bootcamp at the soyHenry academy, in this academy I learned more deeply the javascript world using mainly ReactJs and doing projects individually building knowledge due to research in various sources such as videos on YouTube, official documentation and all the material that is disseminated on the web, as a final project in the bootcamp, Scrum was put into practice as agile methodologies in a group project
